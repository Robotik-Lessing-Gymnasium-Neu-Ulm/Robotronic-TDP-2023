\section{Development \& Testing}

\subsection{Development}
Due to the pandemic we weren't able to get much experience. In 2022 we had our first real RoboCup
in the LightWeight International League. With this experience we started to design the 2023 Robot.
\newline
The design of our robots aims to be as rigid as possible, while keeping the robot light.
To achieve this goal, we used Carbon and 3D printed Parts in combination with thin circuit boards.
In combination with our Software, we are able to travel with high speeds to the ball and
hit a goal.

\subsection{Mechanical Design}
All our parts were designed using 'Autodesk Inventor 2023 Professional' and 'Autodesk Eagle 9.6.2'.
Most of our parts are printed with our Prusa MK3S+ and the Carbon rings are CNC-Machined
with our self build CNC-Machine.
\newline

    \label{fig:OmniWheels}
\end{wrapfigure}

The whole design aims to be fast, reliable and robust. To achieve this goal, we put all the force
into two Carbon Rings. Carbon Fiber has a high strength and low weight.
\newline
Traveling with high speeds, while being strong is also a huge challenge. To achieve this, we use high quality
Maxon DC Motors in combination with the VNH3SP30 driver chip. To put the force on the ground, we designed
new Omniwheels.
The OmniWheel consists of two independent aluminum pieces screwed together. For the small wheels we use a small
aluminum piece covered with an O-Ring out of EPDM plastic.
\newline
To protect this whole construction from the opponent robot, everything is moved 1.5 cm into the robot and a 3D
printed protector covers the whole inner side of the robot.
\newline

\subsection{Electrical Design}
To detect various elements and control the whole robot we use a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. All electronic
parts are soldered to circuit boards.
\newline
We have a total of four Circuit Boards:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Line Detection PCB} \label{PCB:LD}
    \item{Step Up PCB} \label{PCB:SU}
    \item{Controller PCB} \label{PCB:C}
    \item{Infrared Seeker PCB} \label{PCB:IS}
\end{enumerate}
Each Circuit Board has a predetermined task and all the above are controlled by the Teensy 4.1.

We order our Circuit Boards from a local company and solder the parts on the boards.

\subsubsection{Line Detection PCB}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{4cm}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{img/eagle/LineDedectionPCB.png}
    \caption{PCB}
    \label{fig:LDPCB}
\end{wrapfigure}

\ref{PCB:LD} The Line Detection PCB consists of a circle and a cross of phototransistor pairs. To connect all
48 sensors to our main controller, we use analog multiplexer. The multiplexers are switched parallel
to save ports.
\newline
As you can see on the right, we use pairs of two phototransistors and one led. We found out, this is the 
best way to detect the line.

\subsubsection{Step Up PCB}
\ref{PCB:SU} Because a simple solenoid with 12V isn't strong enough, we use a selfmade 
StepUp converter. It consists of a controller and a coil to convert the 12V
to 48V - the maximum allowed.
\newline

\subsubsection{Controller PCB}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{5cm}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{img/eagle/ControllerPCB.png}
    \caption{PCB}
    \label{fig:CPCB}
\end{wrapfigure}

\ref{PCB:C} To control our whole robot we have a circuit board with two microcontrollers. One Teensy 4.0 and one Teensy 4.1. The 4.0 is to communicate with
mouse sensor over SPI. The Teensy 4.1 controls our motors, reads the values from all multiplexers and the compass sensor. The communication is also 
handled by the Teensy 4.1. 
\newline
As you can see on the right~\ref{fig:CPCB}, the power management is also done on the controller PCB.
\newline

For on the way debug, we have a total of eight small SMD-LED´s on our circuit board.
Each is light up, if an specific condition is reached.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Cameras are functioning correctly}
    \item{Compass direction equals robot direction}
    \item{IR Ball is detected}
    \item{Line is detected}
\end{enumerate}

\hfill \break
For changes on the flight, we also have four buttons. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Calibration of robot}
    \item{Shoot test}
    \item{Delete previous IR-Calibration and start scanning for new one}
    \item{Save new IR values}
\end{enumerate}
\hfill \break

We put as much as possible on this circuit board, to save space and weight.

\subsubsection{Infrared Seeker PCB}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{5cm}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{img/eagle/IrSeekerPCB.png}
    \caption{PCB}
    \label{fig:ISPCB}
\end{wrapfigure}

\ref{PCB:IS} To detect the ball as fast, reliable and precise as possible
our IR Seeker circuit board consists out of a ring with a total of 16 TSSP4038,
all connected with a multiplexer chip. 
\newline
The TSSP4038 are the most commonly used IR sensors in the RoboCup Junior LightWeight
league. But instead of using the direct output, we convert it to an analog signal
With this method, we can detect an approximate distance to the ball. Our total speed
depends on this distance, as closer we get, the slower we drive, to enhance the accuracy. 
\newline 

\subsection{Software} %hier muss noch UNDBEDINGT, zwischen Torwart und Stürmer unterschieden werden.
As we all know, that's the objective:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Approach the ball quickly and precisely to get it into the ball pit.}
    \item{Aim for the goal as quickly as possible.}
    \item{Score as fast as possible.}
\end{enumerate}
Accordingly, a modularization of the code can be set up.

\subsubsection{Ball approach}
Our idea was to set up an imaginary approach circle around the ball, which is then approached tangentially. The speed is to be controlled in the process. On the one hand, with the distance to the ball and the targeted distance of the radius of the imaginary circle. On the other hand, with the angle, whereby the aim is to place the robot exactly behind the ball. The output of the PID controllers was transferred to the motor formula with a convex combination via the distance to the ball.

If the ball is now in front of the robot, it is driven straight ahead until the ball is registered in the ball pit with the light barrier. Then the next module is activated.
